# compiler-parser-lexical-analyzer-in-c-flex-bison
 Compiler construction: syntax analyzing using  flex and bison parser. and also coded in a c++ program.

you can see generated tokens in tokens.txt, the main source file of program is source.txt.

further more when you run the main.cpp , it takes the main source.txt file where the language code is written. 
than it tokenizes every possible token and check the grammar of the language, if there is matching syntax as per CFG of the langauge than it identifies it. 

you can check CFG of pedestal language in rec_parse.cpp or in flex and bison file.

thanks.
